# Corporate Finance Model Using FAST Standards – Kenyan Tobacco Manufacturer

## Overview

This project builds a **corporate finance model** for a listed tobacco
manufacturer in Kenya, structured according to the **FAST (Flexible,
Appropriate, Structured, Transparent)** financial modelling standard.

The model integrates historical financials, operating drivers and funding
assumptions into a fully linked **Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
Statement**, and produces valuation outputs (enterprise value, equity value)
plus scenario analysis on key revenue and margin drivers.

## Business Context

The model is designed from the perspective of an **equity / credit analyst or
corporate finance practitioner** evaluating a mature, cash-generative business
in a regulated sector.

Typical questions this model helps address:

- How do changes in **volume, pricing, excise/tax and margins** affect earnings
  and cash flow?
- What is the company worth under different **base / bull / bear** scenarios?
- How resilient is the capital structure (leverage, coverage, liquidity) under
  stress?
- How does the company look from both a **valuation** and **credit** angle?

The structure is generic enough to be adapted for other corporates with similar
characteristics.

## Model Scope & Features

- **Integrated three-statement model**
  - Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow linked via standard
    accounting relationships.
- **Driver-based operating assumptions**
  - Volume and price drivers for revenue.
  - Margin assumptions by major cost line.
  - Capex, working capital and tax assumptions.
- **Funding & capital structure**
  - Debt schedules, interest expense and repayments.
  - Equity assumptions where relevant.
- **Valuation outputs**
  - Enterprise value and equity value based on projected cash flows.
  - Sensitivity to key value drivers (growth, margins, discount rate, exit
    multiple, etc., depending on implementation).
- **Scenario analysis**
  - Base / bull / bear (or equivalent) cases defined via key operating and
    macro assumptions.
  - Comparison of key metrics and valuation across scenarios.

## FAST Standard Approach

The model follows the principles of the **FAST** standard:

- **Flexible** – easy to extend with additional scenarios or drivers.  
- **Appropriate** – focused on the level of detail that supports the decision
  at hand (valuation / credit / strategy), without unnecessary complexity.  
- **Structured** – consistent layout, clear separation of inputs, workings and
  outputs.  
- **Transparent** – simple, readable formulas and a clear flow from
  assumptions to financial statements and valuation.

This makes the model easier to review, audit and reuse.

## How to Use

1. Open the Excel file (e.g. `MAT_Start_Model_01a.xlsm` or equivalent).
2. Review **Inputs / Assumptions**:
   - Operating drivers (volumes, prices, margins, capex, working capital).
   - Funding structure (debt, interest, repayments).
   - Valuation parameters (where applicable).
3. Inspect the **historical** and **projected**:
   - Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement.
   - Key ratios (profitability, leverage, coverage, returns).
4. Use the **scenario and sensitivity** sections to:
   - Compare base / bull / bear cases.
   - See how valuation and credit metrics respond to changes in assumptions.
5. Use the outputs to form a **valuation / credit view** and to support
   discussions with investors, lenders or internal stakeholders.
